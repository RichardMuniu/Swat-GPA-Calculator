# Swat-GPA-Calculator
Work in progress: uses regex to match credits and grades and extract them from the page content then does some quick math to compute one's weighted GPA. Page content must be pasted in due to the lack of API call permissions, even for CORS requests.

Currently working on handling regex unexpected behavior due to non-standard carriage return, which seems to be shortening input text.
